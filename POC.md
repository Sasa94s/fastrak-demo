### 2. React/.NET Webhooks Handlers
These are the actual “receiver” endpoints and processing logic for the corresponding webhook events:

### 4. Store / Merchant Website
- A **Shopify Frontend Plugin** to display, manage, or add products in the merchant’s Shopify store.

## Proof of Concept
This project demonstrates how to:

- Create and manage webhooks with various e-commerce platforms.
- Handle webhook data within a unified .NET/React architecture.
- Optionally embed functionality into Shopify (e.g., product synchronization, order management).

---

## Real-World API Integration Steps

Below is an outline of the tasks needed to integrate real e-commerce platforms and handle their events:

1. **Obtain Developer Credentials**
  - Sign up for developer or affiliate programs (Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Shopify, BigCommerce, Magento, WooCommerce, Alibaba, etc.).

2. **Authenticate with the API**
  - Use OAuth flows, API keys, tokens, etc., as required by each platform.

3. **Implement the External API Calls**
  - **Create Webhook**: Register the webhook endpoint with the external platform.
  - **Configure Webhook**: Set event types to listen for (e.g., order creation).
  - **Test Webhook**: Validate that your endpoint receives the event payload.
  - **Monitor Webhook**: Ensure reliability, handle retries if needed.
  - **Handle Webhook Events**: Parse and process the incoming data.
  - **Store Webhook Data**: Save or update relevant info (orders, products, etc.) in your database.
  - **Send Webhook Data to External System**: Forward or sync with other platforms if needed.
  - **Handle Errors & Retry**: Log failures and re-attempt or queue events.
  - **Log Webhook Events**: Maintain an audit trail for debugging and analytics.

4. **Store or Cache the Data (Optional)**
  - Use a database or cache layer to store product, order, or inventory data for quick retrieval and consistency.

5. **Display Data in React**
  - Show product details, images, pricing.
  - Provide an “Add to Shopify store” button or other interactive functionality.

6. **Push to Shopify Store**
  - Use the **AddToShopifyStore** IFrame Embedded App or direct Admin API calls to create or update products in a connected Shopify store.

## Shopify

### Dependencies
- [ShopifySharp](https://github.com/nozzlegear/ShopifySharp/tree/master)  
  [Documentation](https://github.com/nozzlegear/ShopifySharp/blob/master/ShopifySharp.Extensions.DependencyInjection/README.md)

ShopifySharp is a helpful library to streamline integration with Shopify’s REST and GraphQL APIs. It offers endpoints for managing products, orders, customers, and more.
